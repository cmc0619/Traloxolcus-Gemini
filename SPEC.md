# SPEC.md – Multi-Camera Pi 5 Soccer Recording System

Version 1.2

## TL;DR

Build a three-camera synchronized 4K recording system using three Raspberry Pi 5 nodes, each equipped with an Arducam IMX686 camera and NVMe storage.
Cameras are placed along the sideline (left, center, right).

Each Pi:

* Records 4K30 H.265 continuously for 90+ minutes
* Uses WiFi mesh for communication
* Exposes a mobile-friendly Web UI + REST API
* Provides audio feedback
* Maintains tight time sync via NTP/Chrony
* Stores metadata & manifests for stitching + ML
* Auto-deletes recordings after confirmed offload
* Runs in Production Mode with no disk logging
* Performs automatic GitHub-based software updates

---

## 1. System Overview

The system consists of three independent Pi-Cam nodes ("CAM_L", "CAM_C", "CAM_R") that:

* Capture synchronized 4K footage
* Serve a phone-accessible UI via WiFi mesh
* Store video to NVMe
* Provide status, health, and framing assistance
* Export recordings for downstream stitching + ML on a laptop
* Automatically clean up files post-offload
* Stay updated via GitHub Releases

**CAM_C** acts as time master for NTP synchronization.

## 2. Hardware Specification

### 2.1 Required Per Node

* Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB recommended)
* Arducam 64MP Autofocus (IMX686)
* NVMe SSD (512GB minimum)
* Pi 5 NVMe carrier
* Tripod + adjustable camera mount
* USB-C battery bank or field battery pack
* Small speaker/buzzer

**Optional:**

* UPS HAT for voltage reporting
* Weatherproof housing

### 2.2 Field Deployment Layout

* **CAM_L** → left sideline corner
* **CAM_C** → midfield (also NTP master)
* **CAM_R** → right sideline corner
* Mounted 6–12 ft high
* Slight downward tilt, overlapping coverage

## 3. Networking

### 3.1 WiFi Mesh

* All Pis join the same WiFi mesh network.
* Operator’s phone also joins this network.

### 3.2 Web Server on Each Pi

* Automatically starts on boot
* Mobile-friendly
* Allows:
  * Framing
  * Starting/stopping recording
  * Checking status across all nodes

### 3.3 AP Fallback

* If Pi cannot join WiFi mesh after N seconds:
  * Switch to Access Point mode:
  * SSID: `SOCCER_CAM_{L|C|R}`
  * WPA2 password configurable
* UI must indicate AP Mode clearly.

## 4. Time Synchronization

### 4.1 Architecture

* **CAM_C** = NTP master
* **CAM_L** and **CAM_R** = NTP clients
* Drift must remain < 5 ms

### 4.2 Sync Reporting

Each node exposes:

* Current offset
* Sync confidence
* Master timestamp at recording start
* Local timestamp at recording start

### 4.3 Sync Event (Optional)

* At recording start:
  * All Pis emit a short beep simultaneously
  * Helps visual/audio alignment in downstream ML

## 5. Recording Specifications

### 5.1 Capture Format

* **Resolution**: 3840×2160
* **FPS**: 30
* **Codec**: H.265 (preferred), fallback H.264
* **Bitrate**: 25–35 Mbps
* **Container**: MP4 or MKV
* **Audio**: selectable (ON/OFF)
* **Duration**: 110 minutes continuous

### 5.2 File Naming

`{SESSION_ID}_{CAM_ID}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.mp4`

### 5.3 Recording Behavior

* Must never drop frames if CPU available
* Must surface encoder failures clearly
* Must warn if disk free < threshold
* Must include a test mode:
  * “10-second test recording” with pass/fail indicators

## 6. Web UI

### 6.1 Dashboard View (Aggregated)

Each camera shows:

* CAM ID
* Recording status
* Resolution/FPS/codec/bitrate
* NVMe free space + estimated recording time
* Battery % (if supported)
* Temperature
* Time sync offset
* Live preview (MJPEG or still-frame refresh)

### 6.2 Controls

* Start Recording (all nodes)
* Stop Recording
* Lock View (with audio tone + stored snapshot)
* Toggle audio channel
* Edit session metadata
* Run test recording
* Shutdown node
* Switch mode (Dev ↔ Prod)

### 6.3 Settings

* Bitrate / Codec
* Camera ID assignment
* WiFi settings
* AP fallback settings
* Version info & update controls

## 7. REST API

**Base path**: `/api/v1`

**Endpoints**:

* `GET /status`
* `POST /record/start`
* `POST /record/stop`
* `GET /recordings`
* `POST /recordings/confirm` (checksum verification)
* `GET /config`
* `POST /config`
* `GET /logs` (disabled in Production Mode)
* `POST /shutdown`
* `POST /selftest`
* `POST /update/check`
* `POST /update/apply`

## 8. Session Manifest

Each Pi writes:
`{SESSION_ID}_{CAM_ID}.json`

Includes:

* Recording file name
* Start time local
* Start time master
* Offset ms
* Duration
* Resolution / FPS / codec / bitrate
* Dropped frames
* Camera position metadata
* Base64 snapshot from framing
* SHA-256 video checksum
* `offloaded`: true|false
* Software version

## 9. File Offload & Auto-Cleanup

### 9.1 Offload Protocol

* External device downloads recordings and manifests.
* Checksum verification is REQUIRED.

### 9.2 Confirmation Endpoint

Client posts:

```json
POST /recordings/confirm
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "camera_id": "...",
  "file": "...",
  "checksum": {
    "algo": "sha256",
    "value": "<hex>"
  }
}
```

Pi verifies and marks file as `offloaded=true`.

### 9.3 Auto-Cleanup Rules

If `offloaded=true` and:

* “Delete after confirm” enabled → delete immediately
* OR disk free < threshold → delete oldest offloaded files

### 9.4 Manual Cleanup

* UI exposes “Delete all offloaded files”.

## 10. Logging & Operating Modes

### 10.1 Production Mode (Default)

* No persistent disk logging
* Only in-memory status + transient error fields
* `/logs` endpoint returns minimal info
* No access/request logs saved

### 10.2 Development Mode

* Full logs under `/var/log/soccer_rig/`
* For debugging only
* Switchable via Web UI

## 11. Power & Shutdown

* Battery % displayed if hardware supports it
* Threshold warnings at 20% and 10%
* Must refuse new recordings under critical battery
* UI “Shutdown All Nodes” and per-node shutdown
* Graceful shutdown:
  * Stop recording
  * Flush buffers
  * Unmount NVMe
  * Power down

## 12. Live Streaming (Optional)

* Called “Grandma Mode”.
* Low-res (720p, 2–4 Mbps)
* Must not affect main 4K recording
* If CPU load high → auto-disable stream

## 13. Software Updates (GitHub-Based Updater)

### 13.1 Update Source

Updates pulled from GitHub Releases of a specified repo.

### 13.2 Update Workflow

1. Operator presses “Check for Updates”.
2. Pi queries GitHub Releases API.
3. If a newer version exists:
    * Download .tar.gz or .deb from GitHub
    * Verify checksum (if provided)
    * Install update
    * Restart services (camera-recorder, web-ui, sync-agent)
    * Display version in UI: `"version": "soccer-rig-1.2.0"`

### 13.3 Requirements

* Must not interrupt active recordings
* If recording active, updater returns: `409: Recording in progress`
* Updates should be atomic:
  * Download to temp dir
  * Extract / apply
  * Switch symlink or install package

### 13.4 UI Integration

* “Check for Update”
* “Apply Update”
* Version display
* Update history

## 14. Data Offload Workflow

* Web UI lists files + manifests
* Bulk download available
* Retention policies configurable
* Only offloaded (confirmed) files eligible for auto-delete

## 15. Safety & Failure Modes

* If camera not detected → block recording
* If NVMe missing/not writable → block recording
* If temperature high → warn + tone
* If sync offset > threshold → warn
* If WiFi connection lost → still record locally

## 16. Non-Goals

* On-device ML
* Real-time stitching
* GPS-based positioning
* Cloud upload
* Cellular backhaul
